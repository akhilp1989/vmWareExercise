## I have created a React App and the code lies inside the src folder
## I was not able to import mock.js file because it was throwing an error with RX.Obseravable.interval(1000)
  
  I have only used one external library "@iconify/icons-dashicons/star-filled" for the favorites which can be imported like below
   // npm install --save-dev @iconify/react @iconify/icons-dashicons
    import { Icon, InlineIcon } from '@iconify/react';
